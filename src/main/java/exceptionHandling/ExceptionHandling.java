	// 1. Throws declaration ==> Checked Exceptions ==> When we know the exception in advance
	// 2. Try and Catch block ==> Unchecked Exceptions ==> When we don't know the exception in advance
	// 3. Throw an custom exception  ==> When there is no inbuilt exception available, we can create our own exception
